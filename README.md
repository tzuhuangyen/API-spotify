# [API-Spotify] (https://tzuhuangyen.github.io/API-Spotify/)
This web application allows users to search for songs using keywords. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Axios library for making requests to the Spotify API.

The application uses the Spotify API's /v1/search endpoint to search for songs based on a keyword. When the user submits the search query, the application sends a request to the Spotify API using the Axios library. The response from the API is then displayed on the screen, showing a list of songs that match the search query.
